# **Robo-Advisors**

## ***Overview and Origin*** 

&emsp; The concept of the whole technology itself was nothing revolutionary. Human portfolio managers have been using automated portfolio allocation software since the early 2000s. But until 2008, not many individuals are able procure the technology, so clients had to employ a financial advisor to benefit from the innovation. 

Today, most robo-advisors put to use passive indexing strategies that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), Halal investing, or tactical strategies that mimic hedge funds (FRANKENFIELD, 2021).

The advent of modern robo-advisors has completely changed that narrative by delivering the service straight to consumers. After years of development, robo-advisors have become capable of handling much more sophisticated tasks, such as:

* tax-loss harvesting
* investment selection
* retirement planning.

During the height of the Great Recession, the first robo-advisor, Betterment was launched in 2008.  Its initial purpose was to rebalance assets within target-date funds as a way for investors to manage passive, buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface. (FRANKENFIELD, 2021)

## ***How did the company (or project) come about?***
After decades working at the highest levels of Australia’s financial services industry, they had identified that it was difficult, confusing, expensive and frustrating for most Australian investors to get professional, low-cost investment management (Six Park Asset Management PTY LTD, 2020).

Diversifying your investments across different asset classes has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to reduce risk and improve returns. Hence, their portfolios comprise a mix of up to seven asset classes, each of which has its own risk/reward profile.

## **Investment Philosophy**

For each asset class, Six Park has selected a suitable exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs are low-cost investment funds that can be purchsed and sold on the ASX like shares. At the end of August 2020, there were more than 200 exchange-traded products listed on the ASX – more than twice as many options as there were just five years ago. And exchange-traded products represented an all-time high of more than $70 billion of assets under management. That means it’s becoming harder to evaluate what are the best Australian ETFs (Six Park Asset Management PTY LTD, 2021).

Using ETFs means you’re buying into literally thousands of companies, sectors and assets – instantly and inexpensively delivering a truly diversified portfolio through a single investment.

We believe strongly in the benefits of low-cost, passive investments like ETFs. It’s tough to ‘pick winners’ or ‘time the market’ in a way that consistently and meaningfully beats the market. Instead, we believe the best approach is to focus on passive, broad-based index funds like ETFs – to buy the market, rather than try to beat it.

## **Company Funding**

Six Park is a privately owned Australian company. The company was funded with an initial seed round of $1.4m AUD funding, followed by two early-stage VC deals (Six Park Company Profile: Valuation & Investors | PitchBook, n.d.).

In 2018, Six Park is backed by former finance minister Lindsay Tanner has closed a nearly $2 million funding round and now plans to snare partnerships with big banks on the hunt for technological advantage. It is the third round of funding for Melbourne-based automated investment platform Six Park, which has now raised a total of $5 million in 2018 from a raft of investors including founding head of the Future Fund Paul Costello, former Future Fund board guardian and chairman of JPMorgan Australia Brian Watson and Mr Tanner (Uribe, 2018).

# **Business Activities**
## **Tackling a Specific Financial Problem**
In the case of Six Park, both founders decided they could no longer ignore a major problem in Australia's investment management industry after years of working in the finance industry, – namely, that it was difficult, confusing, expensive and frustrating for most Australian investors to get professional, low-cost investment advice (Six Park Asset Management PTY LTD, 2020).

There are many arguments for and against using a Robo adviser. It takes a lot of time to research stocks, evaluate them, and decide which ones to buy or sell. This is what has traditionally been done by investors; however, a roboadvisor service can do this work automatically without any human intervention.

With a robo-advisor, one doesn’t have to spend hours scanning your portfolio every day for changes in prices or trends then reacting accordingly. The best part is all these tasks are handled by an algorithm with no emotions (or feelings) involved so it’s less likely that a rash decisions will be made based on market swings and other outside pressures like stock-picking experts who have ulterior motives behind their recommendations (Captain FI, 2021).

## **Unique Offering**
Six Park has a unique approach to asset allocation approach, prioritising asset classes that produce both income and capital growth.

<img align="right" img src="https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/sci-tech/2019/October/Gold-bullion-bullion-Gold-bar-shut.jpg" width="300" height="200">

Six Park allocates less to growth assets for more conservative portfolios (27.5% – 40%), as they believe consumers who profile “conservative” prioritise protection against losing money over the prospect of higher returns. This may result in lower returns but carries lower risk.

Six Park doesn’t use gold as part of its portfolios for several reasons including its level of volatility. 
Gold’s “safe haven/store of wealth” status has led to elevated volatility in the past and is questionable going forward. ASX-listed gold ETF is now down almost 20% from its 2020 highs, whilst the rebound in global share markets during the end of 2020 and early 2021 has rewarded the patient investors who stayed the course and earned dividends and interest during this period (Jonsson, 2021).

It is also an unnecessary drag on overall portfolio performance and that there are more efficient ways to achieve an optimal asset class investment mix with other growth and defensive investments. They believe that the most reliable long-term strategy is to have a diverse porfolio across asset classes, sectors, and industries, with many providing dividend income. 

Since it’s tough to ‘pick winners’ or ‘time the market’ in a way that consistently and meaningfully beats the market. Best approach is to focus on passive, broad-based index funds like ETFs – to buy the market, rather than try to beat it.

## **Deployed Technologies**

Six Park uses 25 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack.

Six Park is actively using 50 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SPF (Six Park - Tech Stack, Apps, Patents & Trademarks, n.d.).

# **Business Landscape & Results**

## **Major Trends & Innovations of This Domain**

The use of automated investment platforms, known as robo-advisers, has grown tremendously in the last decade. With these services, investors answer a few questions about their risk tolerance, savings goals and timeline. A portfolio is then generated for them, with guidance on how often and how much to contribute, as well as a visual of how likely they are to achieve their goals.  

The growth can be attributed to three factors: increasing accessibility, affordability and awareness of advice. There is healthy competition throughout the space and over the last few years we have seen the quality of this industry rise year after year while fees are compressing.


## **Business Impact of the Company**
Robo-advisors provide more accessible investing and money management options at a fraction of the cost historically available in traditional models, empowering more individuals to save, invest, and grow money towards financial freedom. But there are several factors to consider when searching for the right robo-advisor to both give you a holistic sense of your total financial picture and help keep you on track toward reaching your financial goals during turbulent market conditions.

To make it easier, this unbiased, comprehensive comparison of the top robo-advisors is based on our own proprietary rating methodology that measures cash management, goal planning tools, fees, portfolio management, mobile functionality, socially conscious investing, portfolio construction, and other pertinent variables (Best Robo-Advisors, 2022).

## **Core Metrics for Success within the Industry**
Most Robo-Advisory companies uses 1 year, 3 years and 5 years % of return based on 5 different risk profiles. Due to how risk metrics are measured in different companies, an average of their most recent % return, top 5 risk profiles are taken for the purpose of the case study to determine how well Six Park fair against its competitors. 

&emsp;

|  | SixPark | StockSpot |	Raiz Invest | InvestSmart
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 year Return % |	4.9%|12.8% |15.4% |11.9%
3 year Return %| 9.1%	| 9.1% |	7.9% |	9.8%|	Completed
5 year Return % |8.5%	| $7.8%	| N/A	| 8.3%
###### *Each % results are the performance average of all portfolio packages

&emsp;

Based on the research data, Six Park’s portfolio return performs the best in a 5 years period but performs the worst in a 1 year period. This is high possibly due to Six Park allocates less to growth assets for more conservative portfolios (27.5% – 40%), as they believe consumers who profile “conservative” prioritise protection against losing money over the prospect of higher returns (lower returns but carries lower risk)

It is important to realise that past performance is not indicative of future performance, however the previous trend with highly diversified investments is that over a long enough time period they generally grow in value.
