## How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?

The technology itself was nothing new. Human wealth managers have been using automated portfolio allocation software since the early 2000s. But until 2008, they were the only ones who could procure the technology, so clients had to employ a financial advisor to benefit from the innovation.

Today, most robo-advisors put to use passive indexing strategies that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), Halal investing, or tactical strategies that mimic hedge funds.

The advent of modern robo-advisors has completely changed that narrative by delivering the service straight to consumers. After years of development, robo-advisors have become capable of handling much more sophisticated tasks, such as tax-loss harvesting, investment selection, and retirement planning.

The first robo-advisor, Betterment, launched in 2008 and started taking investor money in 2010, during the height of the Great Recession. Its initial purpose was to rebalance assets within target-date funds as a way for investors to manage passive, buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface.

## Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

Six Park doesn’t use gold as part of its portfolios for several reasons including its level of volatility. 
Gold’s “safe haven/store of wealth” status has led to elevated volatility in the past and is questionable going forward. ASX-listed gold ETF is now down almost 20% from its 2020 highs, whilst the rebound in global share markets during the end of 2020 and early 2021 has rewarded the patient investors who stayed the course and earned dividends and interest during this period(Jonsson, 2021).

It is also an unnecessary drag on overall portfolio performance and that there are more efficient ways to achieve an optimal asset class investment mix with other growth and defensive investments. They believe that the most reliable long-term strategy is to have a diverse porfolio across asset classes, sectors, and industries, with many providing dividend income. 

Since it’s tough to ‘pick winners’ or ‘time the market’ in a way that consistently and meaningfully beats the market. Best approach is to focus on passive, broad-based index funds like ETFs – to buy the market, rather than try to beat it.

## What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

The use of automated investment platforms, known as robo-advisers, has grown tremendously in the last decade. With these services, investors answer a few questions about their risk tolerance, savings goals and timeline. A portfolio is then generated for them, with guidance on how often and how much to contribute, as well as a visual of how likely they are to achieve their goals.  

The growth can be attributed to three factors: increasing accessibility, affordability and awareness of advice. There is healthy competition throughout the space and over the last few years we have seen the quality of this industry rise year after year while fees are compressing.
