# **Robo-Advisors**

## ***Overview and Origin*** 

The concept of the whole technology itself was nothing revolutionary. Human portfolio managers have been using automated portfolio allocation software since the early 2000s. But until 2008, not many individuals are able procure the technology, so clients had to employ a financial advisor to benefit from the innovation. 

Today, most robo-advisors put to use passive indexing strategies that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), Halal investing, or tactical strategies that mimic hedge funds (FRANKENFIELD, 2021).

The advent of modern robo-advisors has completely changed that narrative by delivering the service straight to consumers. After years of development, robo-advisors have become capable of handling much more sophisticated tasks, such as:

* Tax-loss harvesting
* Investment selection
* Retirement planning.

During the height of the Great Recession, the first robo-advisor, Betterment was launched in 2008.  Its initial purpose was to rebalance assets within target-date funds as a way for investors to manage passive, buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface. (FRANKENFIELD, 2021)

&emsp;
## **Background**

Six Park was founded in 2014. It was by 
- Brian Watson AO - former JP Morgan Australia chairman
- Pat Garrett (co-Chief Executive Officer) - 25-year career in the financial services industry. Since 2005, Pat has worked at Georgica Associates, a private investment management firm based in Melbourne.

&emsp;

## ***How did the company (or project) come about?***
After decades working at the highest levels of Australia’s financial services industry, they had identified that it was difficult, confusing, expensive and frustrating for most Australian investors to get professional, low-cost investment management (Six Park Asset Management PTY LTD, 2020).

Diversifying your investments across different asset classes has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to reduce risk and improve returns. Hence, their portfolios comprise a mix of up to seven asset classes, each of which has its own risk/reward profile.

&emsp;

## **Investment Philosophy**

For each asset class, Six Park has selected a suitable exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs are low-cost investment funds that can be purchsed and sold on the ASX like shares. At the end of August 2020, there were more than 200 exchange-traded products listed on the ASX – more than twice as many options as there were just five years ago. And exchange-traded products represented an all-time high of more than $70 billion of assets under management. That means it’s becoming harder to evaluate what are the best Australian ETFs (Six Park Asset Management PTY LTD, 2021).

Using ETFs means you’re buying into literally thousands of companies, sectors and assets – instantly and inexpensively delivering a truly diversified portfolio through a single investment.

We believe strongly in the benefits of low-cost, passive investments like ETFs. It’s tough to ‘pick winners’ or ‘time the market’ in a way that consistently and meaningfully beats the market. Instead, we believe the best approach is to focus on passive, broad-based index funds like ETFs – to buy the market, rather than try to beat it.

## **Company Funding**

Six Park is a privately owned Australian company. The company was funded with an initial seed round of $1.4m AUD funding, followed by two early-stage VC deals (Six Park Company Profile: Valuation & Investors | PitchBook, n.d.). 

| Deal Type | Date | Amount |	Raised to Date | Status
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Early-Stage VC |	05-Feb-2018	|$2.0M |	Classified |	Completed 
Early-Stage| 09-Jan-2017	| Classified |	Classified |	Completed
Seed Round |30-May-2016	| $1.4m	| N/A	| Completed

In 2018, Six Park is backed by former finance minister Lindsay Tanner has closed a nearly $2 million funding round and now plans to snare partnerships with big banks on the hunt for technological advantage. It is the third round of funding for Melbourne-based automated investment platform Six Park, which has now raised a total of $5 million in 2018 from a raft of investors including founding head of the Future Fund Paul Costello, former Future Fund board guardian and chairman of JPMorgan Australia Brian Watson and Mr Tanner (Uribe, 2018).

# **Business Activities**
## **Tackling a Specific Financial Problem**
In the case of Six Park, both founders decided they could no longer ignore a major problem in Australia's investment management industry after years of working in the finance industry, – namely, that it was difficult, confusing, expensive and frustrating for most Australian investors to get professional, low-cost investment advice (Six Park Asset Management PTY LTD, 2020).

There are many arguments for and against using a Robo adviser. It takes a lot of time to research stocks, evaluate them, and decide which ones to buy or sell. This is what has traditionally been done by investors; however, a roboadvisor service can do this work automatically without any human intervention.

With a robo-advisor, one doesn’t have to spend hours scanning your portfolio every day for changes in prices or trends then reacting accordingly. The best part is all these tasks are handled by an algorithm with no emotions (or feelings) involved so it’s less likely that a rash decisions will be made based on market swings and other outside pressures like stock-picking experts who have ulterior motives behind their recommendations (Captain FI, 2021).

## **Unique Offering**
Six Park has a unique approach to asset allocation approach, prioritising asset classes that produce both income and capital growth.

<img align="right" img src="https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/sci-tech/2019/October/Gold-bullion-bullion-Gold-bar-shut.jpg" width="300" height="200">

Six Park allocates less to growth assets for more conservative portfolios (27.5% – 40%), as they believe consumers who profile “conservative” prioritise protection against losing money over the prospect of higher returns. This may result in lower returns but carries lower risk.

Six Park doesn’t use gold as part of its portfolios for several reasons including its level of volatility. 
Gold’s “safe haven/store of wealth” status has led to elevated volatility in the past and is questionable going forward. ASX-listed gold ETF is now down almost 20% from its 2020 highs, whilst the rebound in global share markets during the end of 2020 and early 2021 has rewarded the patient investors who stayed the course and earned dividends and interest during this period (Jonsson, 2021).

It is also creates a burden on overall portfolio performance and that there are more efficient ways to achieve an optimal asset class investment mix with other growth and defensive investments. They believe that the most reliable long-term strategy is to have a diverse porfolio across asset classes, sectors, and industries, with many providing dividend income. 

Since it’s tough to ‘pick winners’ or ‘time the market’ to beat the market. Best approach is to focus on passive, broad-based index funds like ETFs – to buy the market, rather than try to beat it.

## **Deployed Technologies**

Six Park uses 25 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack.

Six Park is actively using 50 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SPF (Six Park - Tech Stack, Apps, Patents & Trademarks, n.d.).

# **Business Landscape & Results**

## **Major Trends & Innovations of This Domain**

The use of automated investment platforms, known as robo-advisers, has grown tremendously in the last decade. With these services, investors answer a few questions about their risk tolerance, savings goals and timeline. A portfolio is then generated for them, with guidance on how often and how much to contribute, as well as a visual of how likely they are to achieve their goals.  

The growth can be attributed to three factors: increasing accessibility, affordability and awareness of advice. There is healthy competition throughout the space and over the last few years we have seen the quality of this industry rise year after year while fees are compressing.

### **New audiences and preferences**
Record-low interest rates on term deposits is encouraging many more millennials to plough their cash into share market investments for the first time in a bid to grow their wealth. About 46% of Australians – or nine million people – now hold investments other than their primary residence or superannuation, according to the Australian Securities Exchange’s 2020 Australian Investor Study (Miles, 2021).

The millennials demographic – those aged between 25 and 40 – many of whom are looking for an alternative for saving their cash for a first home that is growing further out of reach as the property market booms. The boom of cryptocurrency & NFTs also perpetuates this notion as more youngsters are drawn towards the technology & the potential financial opportunities around it.

Younger audiences often have different investment priorities than their parents and grandparents. For example, younger generations tend to value responsible investment options more deeply. Many robo-advisors have added environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investment options to give these investors more opportunity to invest in alignment with their beliefs. 

Additionally, mobile capabilities are key when appealing to younger generations. Having an automated investment advisor is not nearly as attractive to millennials or Gen Zs if they cannot access their investments via their smartphone. Robo-advisors have also added different account types like custodial accounts to introduce more options and better coverage, no matter the investor’s preferences (Allen, 2021). 

Keeping up with technology developments is another way robo-advisors have sought to stay useful. Some investment apps are provided by third parties and require extra work on the part of the user to connect bank accounts and make transfers. Providing everything on the same platform makes investments easy to access and manage. Banks and credit unions have a true advantage here, as offering automated investment management through online and mobile capabilities makes the process that much easier and more secure for the user.

The ability to automatically rebalance portfolios can also help keep investors on target. Similarly, many robo-advisors have added the option for users to update preferences as their lives and goals change. A change in income, career or life priorities like getting married or growing the family can lead to changes in investments. Investing solutions must be flexible and readily adapt when any investment objectives shift.

### **Time to Evolve & Adapt**
Because of the way they have adapted and innovated over time, the popularity of robo-advisors is growing fast. In a recent Access Softek survey, 47% of respondents said they would consider switching their bank or credit union if the competitor offered integrated investment accounts.

Consumers are embracing this new method of investing. Being digitally native, it can work outside normal business hours to accommodate any schedule. And having investments automatically managed reduces the stress & anxiety (especially panic-selling) associated with navigating the stock market.

Robo-advisors should not be seen as an add-on service, but as an integral part of a financial institution’s digital strategy. The addition of a digital investment service with a low barrier of entry creates more touchpoints for the consumer and their financial institution to not only engage, but to complement this robust relationship.


## **Business Impact of the Company**
Robo-advisors provide more accessible investing and money management options at a fraction of the cost historically available in traditional models, empowering more individuals to save, invest, and grow money towards financial freedom. But there are several factors to consider when searching for the right robo-advisor to both give you a holistic sense of your total financial picture and help keep you on track toward reaching your financial goals during turbulent market conditions.

To make it easier, this unbiased, comprehensive comparison of the top robo-advisors is based on our own proprietary rating methodology that measures cash management, goal planning tools, fees, portfolio management, mobile functionality, socially conscious investing, portfolio construction, and other pertinent variables (Best Robo-Advisors, 2022).

## **Core Metrics for Success within the Industry**
Most Robo-Advisory companies uses 1 year, 3 years and 5 years % of return based on 5 different risk profiles. 

Due to how risk metrics are measured in different companies, an average of their most recent % return, top 5 risk profiles are taken for the purpose of the case study to determine how well Six Park fair against its competitors. The results are tabulated in the table below:

## **Competitor Analysis**

|  | SixPark | StockSpot |	Raiz Invest | InvestSmart
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 year Return % |	4.9%|12.8% |15.4% |11.9%
3 year Return %| 9.1%	| 9.1% |	7.9% |	9.8%|	Completed
5 year Return % |8.5%	| $7.8%	| N/A	| 8.3%
###### *Each % results are the performance average of all portfolio packages


Based on the research data, Six Park’s portfolio return performs the best in a 5 years period but performs the worst in a 1 year period. This is high possibly due to Six Park allocates less to growth assets for more conservative portfolios (27.5% – 40%), as they believe consumers who profile “conservative” prioritise protection against losing money over the prospect of higher returns (lower returns but carries lower risk)

In 2021 specifically, Six Park performed in line with general market expectations; Comparing it to the Vanguard diversified high growth fund (ASX:VDHG) on Sharesight you can see the SixPark Aggressive growth option out-performed the Vanguard ETF slightly. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://captainfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SixPark-performance-comparison-VDHG.jpg" width="500" height="450"/> 
</p>

Note that these aren’t’ an exact comparison as the VDHG fund doesn’t have existing historical performance going back that far, although Vanguards Wholesale equivalent fund does, and its Gross performance over the last 10 years was actually 9.58% (Captain FI, 2022)

It is important to realise that past performance is not indicative of future performance, however the previous trend with highly diversified investments is that over a long enough time period they generally grow in value.

# **Recommendations**
## 1.  **Proprietary App Development**
<img align="right" img src="https://kissflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/types-of-application-development.png" width="300" height="200">

The recent trend of accessing stock markets via apps reflects growing interest and acceptance. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of digital transformation for financial services companies. Investment apps in this era not only shifts stock-trading services to an ever-growing mobile environment, but it is completely revamping the whole customer experience itself. Instead of using traditional trading channels with established intermediaries and standard fees, apps provide investors with a brand-new approach gaining direct access to the stock market (Applause App Quality, Inc, 2022).


Most competitors have a proprietary app which allows their customers to access your portfolio anywhere, anytime: an online dashboard and app that lets one manage and oversee their investments. Offering individual ETF choices or access to a dedicated investment advisor. Users/Customers would value flexibility and the ability to be able to tinker with their portfolio asset allocation.

## 2.  **Improve Market Share via Social Media Marketing**

Hiring a suitable influencer/content-creator to promote Six Park’s unique robo-advisor offering. This can be done by leveraging Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). AI-powered influencer marketing tech is helping brands in three key areas: 

* Identifying the right creators/influencer, <img align="right" img src="https://www.investmentexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/800x600-social-media-blocks-niroworld-31867654.jpg" width="300" height="200">
* Providing impactful workflow actions
* Creating more relevant content. 

To adapt to the ever-expanding digital universe, the true advantage of influencer marketing enhanced by data science lies in its ability to consider an infinite amount of data in each recommendation.
 	
### **Enabling content-based influencer classification** ###
NLP AI & Visual Search AI analyse the content of a creator’s posts and generates things like interests, industries, demographics, and brand affinities from them. Influencer platforms use these classifications in ever-evolving discovery search engines (Zulawski, 2020).

### **Wide-scale audience response sentiment analysis** ###
Inspired by how AI processes and draws insights from the content of posts, it can also assess the content and gauge the sentiment of comments (and the posts of the commenters) to draw conclusions/general consensus about the creator’s audiences. Similarly, sentiment analysis AIs can understand the reaction to a piece of content based on likes, shares, comments and engagements. (Zulawski, 2020)
 	
### **Detecting fake engagement and fraudulent influencers** ###
Main challenge of finding the right creators for a brand or industry is made worse by the problem of dishonest influencers using social bots to fabricate their presence, costing the industry $1.3 billion a year. AI can come into the picture by allowing for pattern/footprint analysis at scale among followers or comments, making it easy to distinguish between computer-generated and real-life influencers. 

It simply isn’t possible for organizations to do this manually and compete with a bot generator. Only AI can constantly analyse, maintain, and scale a bank of fraudulent footprints that might indicate fake accounts. (Zulawski, 2020)
